# QChatterBot
A (simple; proof of concept, really) chat bot for QChatter. 

*Version 1.1 -- Commands system implemented more "professionally."*


Very simple. Screenshots of it in usage can be seen in the client program's screenshots, as it is there.

## Usage

Edit the the *main.py* file, to put your bot account's information in there, then run the *main.py* file, to enter the channel name into stdin. Unlike the client, it will automatically join the channel. 

With other users in the channel, you may invoke the bot commands by sending a $ followed by the actual command. Commands support spaces, that is, if you quote them. For example, typing `$ say "Hello, world!"` will make the bot repeat what you have entered.

The commands system is simple and is easy to modify. And I encourage that! If you find this useful, distribute it and modify it and add whatever you'd like. However, with GPLv3, you MUST share the source code. But, hey, who's going to go after you anyway if you don't? It is merely a bot.
